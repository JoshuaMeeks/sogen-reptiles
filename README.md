# SoGen Reptiles

## Short Description
SoGen Reptiles is a proprietary e-commerce platform specializing in the sale of crested geckos from our exclusive inventory.

## Detailed Description
SoGen Reptiles has been developed as a dedicated platform that allows us to directly reach our customers without navigating through third-party restrictions or breaching Terms of Service (TOS) agreements which often hinder the sale of animals on various platforms. The site is tailored to showcase our inventory, allowing customers to make purchases directly, thereby offering us more flexibility and control over the inventory. A significant benefit realized through this direct-to-customer approach is the drastic reduction in seller fees by up to 80%, as opposed to selling on other mainstream platforms.
